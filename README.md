# PhD thesis

This is my dissertation as part of my PhD in Quantitative Life Sciences from McGill University. The thesis itself is `main.pdf`.

To minimize the repo size I have not included the figures. If you want to clone this repo for your own thesis, use the file `placeholder.png` in place of any figures.

This repo contains only the manuscript (written in tex) and the images embedded within the PDF. For the code and respective papers for each chapter see:
