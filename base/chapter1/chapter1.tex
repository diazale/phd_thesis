\textit{No catalog of techniques can convey a willingness to look for what can be seen, whether or not anticipated. Yet this is at the heart of exploratory data analysis. The graph paper---and transparencies---are there, not as a technique, but rather as a recognition that the picture-examining eye is the best finder we have of the wholly unanticipated. \\
