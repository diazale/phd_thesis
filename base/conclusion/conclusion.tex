Pre-amble to the conclusion goes here.

\section{Discussion}

Inferential statistics requires a definition of ``population''\citep{statcan2003}. To establish the scope of a study, we define the ``target population'' (the group to which research applies) and the ``survey population'' (the group which is covered by the study and, ideally, is very similar to the target population). The survey population is ultimately chosen from the survey frame, which provides the means to sample the individuals from the population. [talk about popgen, biobanks, assumptions, etc]

Structure may be subtle and arise from, e.g., recent population structure or admixture\citep{gopalan_human_2022}

Bigger data is not better data. We cannot just collect our way out of this --- we need to understand what it is that we are doing and what we are working with.
