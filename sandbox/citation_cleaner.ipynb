By extracting the ancestral information retained in the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of genomic DNA, the history of migration and reproduction of the population can be reconstructed. Since the SNP data of population are multidimensional, their dimensionality reduction can demonstrate their potential internal connections. In this study, the graph and structure learning based Graph Embedding method commonly used in single cell mRNA sequencing was applied to human population genetics research to decrease the data dimension. As a result, the human population trajectory of East Asia based on 1000 Genomes Project was reconstructed to discover the inseparable relationship between the Chinese population and other East Asian populations. These results are visualized from various ancestry calculators such as E11 and K12B. Finally, the unique SNPs along the psudotime of trajectory were found by differential analysis. Bioprocess enrichment analysis was also used to reveal that the genes of these SNPs may be related to neurological diseases. These results will lay the data foundation for precision medicine.{\\\\textless}/p{\\\\textgreater}},\\n', '\\tlanguage = {en},\\n', '\\turldate = {2020-05-21},\\n', '\\tjournal = {bioRxiv},\\n', '\\tauthor = {Wei, Zhuang and Chang, Ching-Wen and Luo, Van and Bian, Beilei and Ding, Xuewei},\\n', '\\tmonth = dec,\\n', '\\tyear = {2019},\\n', '\\tpages = {870253}\\n', '}\\n', '\\n', '@article{simon_local_2019,\\n', '\\ttitle = {Local introgression at two spatial scales in mosaic hybrid zones of mussels},\\n', '\\tcopyright = {© 2019, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Here we analysed multiple contact zones of the \\\\textit{M. edulis} complex of marine mussel species, which represent a mosaic distribution of heterogeneously differentiated, semi-isolated genomes. Our aim was to contrast ongoing introgression at the heart of hybrid zones, with past introgression between similar parental populations, at increasing distance from the contact. Using a panel of ancestry-informative SNPs derived from a previous genomic study, we first confirm, with a broader sampling, that local introgression, affecting one but not all of the populations compared, is both widespread and heterogeneous across the genome. Some outlier loci show patterns of complete introgression in certain populations, and an absence of introgression in others. Genomic cline analyses reveal a globally high concordance among loci at a local scale, albeit with signals of asymmetric introgression at a few loci. Enhanced local introgression at specific loci is consistent with the early transfer of adaptive variants after contact, possibly including asymmetric bi-stable variants, or less loaded alleles. Given the mosaic structure of the \\\\textit{M. edulis} complex, with a succession of genetic barriers to gene flow, variants with enhanced introgression through one barrier can be trapped, maybe transiently, at the next barrier, confining introgression locally. This makes the \\\\textit{Mytilus} complex an ideal model of the heterogeneous porosity of species barriers.{\\\\textless}/p{\\\\textgreater}},\\n', '\\tlanguage = {en},\\n', '\\turldate = {2020-05-21},\\n', '\\tjournal = {bioRxiv},\\n', '\\tauthor = {Simon, Alexis and Fraïsse, Christelle and Ayari, Tahani El and Liautard-Haag, Cathy and Strelkov, Petr and Welch, John J. and Bierne, Nicolas},\\n', '\\tmonth = oct,\\n', '\\tyear = {2019},\\n', '\\tpages = {818559}\\n', '}\\n', '\\n', '@article{dorrity_dimensionality_2020,\\n', '\\ttitle = {Dimensionality reduction by {UMAP} to visualize physical and genetic interactions},\\n', '\\tvolume = {11},\\n', '\\tcopyright = {2020 The Author(s)},\\n', '\\tissn = {2041-1723},\\n', '\\turl = {https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15351-4},\\n', '\\tdoi = {10.1038/s41467-020-15351-4},\\n', '\\tabstract = {Dimensionality reduction is often used to visualize complex expression profiling data.

To illustrate the promising outcomes of our method, we showed that (i) imputation quality for low frequency alleles can be improved by augmenting reference panels with AGs, (ii) scores obtained from selection tests on AGs and real genomes are highly correlated and (iii) AGs can inherit genotype-phenotype associations.

For Ae. aegypti all Indo-Pacific populations are invasive, having spread from an initial native range of Africa, while for Ae. albopictus the Indo-Pacific includes invasive populations and those from the native range: putatively, India to Japan to Southeast Asia. This study analyses the population genomics of 480 of these mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific. We investigated patterns of genome-wide genetic differentiation to compare pathways of invasion and ongoing gene flow in both species, and to compare invasive and native-range populations of Ae. albopictus. We also tested landscape genomic hypotheses that genetic differentiation would increase with geographical distance and be lower between locations with high connectivity to human transportation routes, the primary means of dispersal at these scales. We found that genetic distances were generally higher in Ae. aegypti, with Pacific populations the most highly differentiated. The most differentiated Ae. albopictus populations were in Vanuatu, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the latter two representing potential native-range populations and potential cryptic subspeciation respectively. Genetic distances in Ae. aegypti increased with geographical distance, while in Ae. albopictus they decreased with higher connectivity to human transportation routes. Contrary to the situation in Ae. aegypti, we found evidence of long-distance Ae. albopictus colonisation events, including colonisation of Mauritius from East Asia and of Fiji from Southeast Asia. These direct genomic comparisons indicate likely differences in dispersal ecology in these species, despite their broadly sympatric distributions and similar use of human transport to disperse.

However, the classical allelic test is limited in applications because it is sensitive to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) assumption, not applicable to continuous traits, and not easy to account for covariate effects or sample correlation. To develop a generalized robust allelic test, we propose a unifying regression model with individual allele as the response variable. We show that the score test statistic derived from this novel regression framework contains a correction factor that explicitly adjusts for the departure from HWE and encompasses the classical allelic test as a special case. When the trait of interest is continuous, the corresponding allelic test evaluates a weighted difference between individual-level allele frequency estimate and sample estimate where the weight is proportional to an individual’s trait value, and the test remains valid under Y-dependent sampling. Finally, the proposed method allows for joint allele-based association analyses of multiple (continuous or binary) phenotypes, in the presence of covariates, sample correlation and population heterogeneity. To support our analytical findings, we provide empirical evidence from both simulation and application studies.{\\\\textless}/p{\\\\textgreater}},\\n', '\\tlanguage = {en},\\n', '\\turldate = {2020-05-21},\\n', '\\tjournal = {bioRxiv},\\n', '\\tauthor = {Zhang, Lin and Sun, Lei},\\n', '\\tmonth = mar,\\n', '\\tyear = {2020},\\n', '\\tpages = {2020.03.12.989004}\\n', '}\\n', '\\n', '@article{mcinnes_umap_2018,\\n', '\\ttitle = {{UMAP}: {Uniform} {Manifold} {Approximation} and {Projection} for {Dimension} {Reduction}},\\n', '\\tshorttitle = {{UMAP}},\\n', '\\turl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426},\\n', '\\tabstract = {UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction.

The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a paradigmatic case: this African megaherbivore suffered a remarkable population reduction in the last 150 years due to human activities. The two white rhinoceros subspecies, the northern (NWR) and the southern white rhinoceros (SWR), however, underwent opposite fates: the NWR vanished quickly after the onset of the decline, while the SWR recovered after a severe bottleneck. Such demographic events are predicted to have an erosive effect at the genomic level, in connection with the extirpation of diversity, and increased genetic drift and inbreeding. However there is currently little empirical data available that allows us to directly reconstruct the subtleties of such processes in light of distinct demographic histories. Therefore to assess these effects, we generated a whole-genome, temporal dataset consisting of 52 re-sequenced white rhinoceros genomes, that represents both subspecies at two time windows: before and during/after the bottleneck. Our data not only reveals previously unknown population substructure within both subspecies, but allowed us to quantify the genomic erosion undergone by both, with post-bottleneck white rhinoceroses harbouring significantly fewer heterozygous sites, and showing higher inbreeding coefficients than pre-bottleneck individuals. Moreover, the effective population size suffered a decrease of two and three orders of magnitude in the NWR and SWR respectively, due to the recent bottleneck. Our data therefore provides much needed empirical support for theoretical predictions about the genomic consequences of shrinking populations, information that is relevant for understanding the process of population extinction. Furthermore, our findings have the potential to inform management approaches for the conservation of the remaining white rhinoceroses.{\\\\textless}/p{\\\\textgreater}},\\n', '\\tlanguage = {en},\\n', '\\turldate = {2020-05-21},\\n', '\\tjournal = {bioRxiv},\\n', '\\tauthor = {Sánchez-Barreiro, Fátima and Gopalakrishnan, Shyam and Ramos-Madrigal, Jazmín and Westbury, Michael V. and Manuel, Marc de and Margaryan, Ashot and Ciucani, Marta M. and Vieira, Filipe G. and Patramanis, Yannis and Kalthoff, Daniela C. and Timmons, Zena and Sicheritz-Pontén, Thomas and Dalén, Love and Ryder, Oliver A. and Zhang, Guojie and Marquès-Bonet, Tomás and Moodley, Yoshan and Gilbert, M.

Using data from a diverse biobank in New York City, we genetically identified 17 sub-populations, and noted the presence of genetic founder effects in 7. By then linking community membership to the EHR, we were able to identify over 600 health outcomes that were statistically enriched within a specific population, with many representing known associations, and many others being novel.

During this time (c. 750 to 1050 CE), the Vikings reached most of western Eurasia, Greenland, and North America, and left a cultural legacy that persists till today. To understand the genetic structure and influence of the Viking expansion, we sequenced the genomes of 442 ancient humans from across Europe and Greenland ranging from the Bronze Age (c. 2400 BC) to the early Modern period (c. 1600 CE), with particular emphasis on the Viking Age. We find that the period preceding the Viking Age was accompanied by foreign gene flow into Scandinavia from the south and east: spreading from Denmark and eastern Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia. Despite the close linguistic similarities of modern Scandinavian languages, we observe genetic structure within Scandinavia, suggesting that regional population differences were already present 1,000 years ago. We find evidence for a majority of Danish Viking presence in England, Swedish Viking presence in the Baltic, and Norwegian Viking presence in Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial foreign European ancestry entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age. We also find that several of the members of the only archaeologically well-attested Viking expedition were close family members. By comparing Viking Scandinavian genomes with present-day Scandinavian genomes, we find that pigmentation-associated loci have undergone strong population differentiation during the last millennia. Finally, we are able to trace the allele frequency dynamics of positively selected loci with unprecedented detail, including the lactase persistence allele and various alleles associated with the immune response. We conclude that the Viking diaspora was characterized by substantial foreign engagement: distinct Viking populations influenced the genomic makeup of different regions of Europe, while Scandinavia also experienced increased contact with the rest of the continent.{\\\\textless}/p{\\\\textgreater}},\\n', '\\tlanguage = {en},\\n', '\\turldate = {2020-05-21},\\n', '\\tjournal = {bioRxiv},\\n', '\\tauthor = {Margaryan, Ashot and Lawson, Daniel and Sikora, Martin and Racimo, Fernando and Rasmussen, Simon and Moltke, Ida and Cassidy, Lara and Jørsboe, Emil and Ingason, Andrés and Pedersen, Mikkel and Korneliussen, Thorfinn and Wilhelmson, Helene and Buś, Magdalena and Damgaard, Peter de Barros and Martiniano, Rui and Renaud, Gabriel and Bhérer, Claude and Moreno-Mayar, J.

We used these data to analyse genetic population structure, and characterise genetic diversity within and between populations. We also illustrate the utility of these data by investigating species differences in isolation by distance, genetic variation within proposed gene drive target sequences, and patterns of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides.

The use of community-detection algorithms from network theory generates a natural hierarchical perspective on the representation that the method produces.

Conversely, unsupervised machine learning (UML) uses inherent data structure and does not require user-specified training labels, potentially providing more objectivity in species delimitation. In the context of integrative taxonomy, we demonstrate the utility of three UML approaches (random forests, variational autoencoders, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) for species delimitation in an arachnid taxon with high population genetic structure (Opiliones, Laniatores, Metanonychus). We find that UML approaches successfully cluster samples according to species-level divergences and not high levels of population structure, while model-based validation methods severely over-split putative species. UML offers intuitive data visualization in two-dimensional space, the ability to accommodate various data types, and has potential in many areas of systematic and evolutionary biology.

Over time, these barriers have led to varying levels of genetic relatedness among individuals. This population structure is informative about human history, and can have a significant impact on studies of medical genetics. Because population structure depends on myriad demographic, ecological, and social forces, a priori visualization is useful to identify subtle patterns of population structure. We use a dimension reduction method—UMAP—to visualize population structure in three genomic datasets and find previously unobserved patterns, revealing fine-scale population structure and illustrating differences between groups in traits such as white blood cell count, height, and FEV1, a measure of lung function. Using UMAP is computationally efficient and can identify fine-scale population structure in large population datasets.

By extracting the ancestral information retained in the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of genomic DNA, the history of migration and reproduction of the population can be reconstructed. Since the SNP data of population are multidimensional, their dimensionality reduction can demonstrate their potential internal connections. In this study, the graph and structure learning based Graph Embedding method commonly used in single cell mRNA sequencing was applied to human population genetics research to decrease the data dimension. As a result, the human population trajectory of East Asia based on 1000 Genomes Project was reconstructed to discover the inseparable relationship between the Chinese population and other East Asian populations. These results are visualized from various ancestry calculators such as E11 and K12B. Finally, the unique SNPs along the psudotime of trajectory were found by differential analysis. Bioprocess enrichment analysis was also used to reveal that the genes of these SNPs may be related to neurological diseases. These results will lay the data foundation for precision medicine.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

      "abstract = {{\\textless}h3{\\textgreater}Abstract{\\textless}/h3{\\textgreater} {\\textless}p{\\textgreater}When the ranges of closely-related lineages are large, and overlapping, we can often study introgression at many “replicated” contacts, with different locations and spatial scales. Here we analysed multiple contact zones of the \\textit{M. edulis} complex of marine mussel species, which represent a mosaic distribution of heterogeneously differentiated, semi-isolated genomes. Our aim was to contrast ongoing introgression at the heart of hybrid zones, with past introgression between similar parental populations, at increasing distance from the contact. Using a panel of ancestry-informative SNPs derived from a previous genomic study, we first confirm, with a broader sampling, that local introgression, affecting one but not all of the populations compared, is both widespread and heterogeneous across the genome. Some outlier loci show patterns of complete introgression in certain populations, and an absence of introgression in others. Genomic cline analyses reveal a globally high concordance among loci at a local scale, albeit with signals of asymmetric introgression at a few loci. Enhanced local introgression at specific loci is consistent with the early transfer of adaptive variants after contact, possibly including asymmetric bi-stable variants, or less loaded alleles. Given the mosaic structure of the \\textit{M. edulis} complex, with a succession of genetic barriers to gene flow, variants with enhanced introgression through one barrier can be trapped, maybe transiently, at the next barrier, confining introgression locally. This makes the \\textit{Mytilus} complex an ideal model of the heterogeneous porosity of species barriers.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

In this study, we demonstrated that deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) can be trained to learn the high dimensional distributions of real genomic datasets and create high quality artificial genomes (AGs) with none to little privacy loss. To illustrate the promising outcomes of our method, we showed that (i) imputation quality for low frequency alleles can be improved by augmenting reference panels with AGs, (ii) scores obtained from selection tests on AGs and real genomes are highly correlated and (iii) AGs can inherit genotype-phenotype associations. AGs have the potential to become valuable assets in genetic studies by providing high quality anonymous substitutes for private databases.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

      "abstract = {{\\textless}p{\\textgreater}The arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) and Ae. albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito) are both common throughout the Indo-Pacific region, where 70\\% of global dengue transmission occurs. For Ae. aegypti all Indo-Pacific populations are invasive, having spread from an initial native range of Africa, while for Ae. albopictus the Indo-Pacific includes invasive populations and those from the native range: putatively, India to Japan to Southeast Asia. This study analyses the population genomics of 480 of these mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific. We investigated patterns of genome-wide genetic differentiation to compare pathways of invasion and ongoing gene flow in both species, and to compare invasive and native-range populations of Ae. albopictus. We also tested landscape genomic hypotheses that genetic differentiation would increase with geographical distance and be lower between locations with high connectivity to human transportation routes, the primary means of dispersal at these scales. We found that genetic distances were generally higher in Ae. aegypti, with Pacific populations the most highly differentiated. The most differentiated Ae. albopictus populations were in Vanuatu, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the latter two representing potential native-range populations and potential cryptic subspeciation respectively. Genetic distances in Ae. aegypti increased with geographical distance, while in Ae. albopictus they decreased with higher connectivity to human transportation routes. Contrary to the situation in Ae. aegypti, we found evidence of long-distance Ae. albopictus colonisation events, including colonisation of Mauritius from East Asia and of Fiji from Southeast Asia. These direct genomic comparisons indicate likely differences in dispersal ecology in these species, despite their broadly sympatric distributions and similar use of human transport to disperse. Our findings will assist biosecurity operations to trace the source of invasive material and for biocontrol operations that benefit from matching genetic backgrounds of released and local populations.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

However, the classical allelic test is limited in applications because it is sensitive to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) assumption, not applicable to continuous traits, and not easy to account for covariate effects or sample correlation. To develop a generalized robust allelic test, we propose a unifying regression model with individual allele as the response variable. We show that the score test statistic derived from this novel regression framework contains a correction factor that explicitly adjusts for the departure from HWE and encompasses the classical allelic test as a special case. When the trait of interest is continuous, the corresponding allelic test evaluates a weighted difference between individual-level allele frequency estimate and sample estimate where the weight is proportional to an individual’s trait value, and the test remains valid under Y-dependent sampling. Finally, the proposed method allows for joint allele-based association analyses of multiple (continuous or binary) phenotypes, in the presence of covariates, sample correlation and population heterogeneity. To support our analytical findings, we provide empirical evidence from both simulation and application studies.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

      "abstract = {The diversity in our genome is crucial to understanding the demographic history of worldwide populations. However, we have yet to know whether subtle genetic differences within a population can be disentangled, or whether they have an impact on complex traits. Here we apply dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, PCA-t-SNE, UMAP, and PCA-UMAP) to biobank-derived genomic data of a Japanese population (n = 169,719). Dimensionality reduction reveals fine-scale population structure, conspicuously differentiating adjacent insular subpopulations. We further enluciate the demographic landscape of these Japanese subpopulations using population genetics analyses. Finally, we perform phenome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses on 67 complex traits. Differences in PRS between the deconvoluted subpopulations are not always concordant with those in the observed phenotypes, suggesting that the PRS differences might reflect biases from the uncorrected structure, in a trait-dependent manner. This study suggests that such an uncorrected structure can be a potential pitfall in the clinical application of PRS.},\n",

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},\n",

      "abstract = {{\\textless}p{\\textgreater}Large vertebrates are extremely sensitive to anthropogenic pressure, and their populations are declining fast. The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a paradigmatic case: this African megaherbivore suffered a remarkable population reduction in the last 150 years due to human activities. The two white rhinoceros subspecies, the northern (NWR) and the southern white rhinoceros (SWR), however, underwent opposite fates: the NWR vanished quickly after the onset of the decline, while the SWR recovered after a severe bottleneck. Such demographic events are predicted to have an erosive effect at the genomic level, in connection with the extirpation of diversity, and increased genetic drift and inbreeding. However there is currently little empirical data available that allows us to directly reconstruct the subtleties of such processes in light of distinct demographic histories. Therefore to assess these effects, we generated a whole-genome, temporal dataset consisting of 52 re-sequenced white rhinoceros genomes, that represents both subspecies at two time windows: before and during/after the bottleneck. Our data not only reveals previously unknown population substructure within both subspecies, but allowed us to quantify the genomic erosion undergone by both, with post-bottleneck white rhinoceroses harbouring significantly fewer heterozygous sites, and showing higher inbreeding coefficients than pre-bottleneck individuals. Moreover, the effective population size suffered a decrease of two and three orders of magnitude in the NWR and SWR respectively, due to the recent bottleneck. Our data therefore provides much needed empirical support for theoretical predictions about the genomic consequences of shrinking populations, information that is relevant for understanding the process of population extinction. Furthermore, our findings have the potential to inform management approaches for the conservation of the remaining white rhinoceroses.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions and non-reference unique insertions in the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP-CEPH) panel, a high-coverage dataset of 911 samples from 54 diverse worldwide populations. We identify in total 126,018 structural variants (25,588 \\&lt;100 bp in size), of which 78\\% are novel. Some reach high frequency and are private to continental groups or even individual populations, including a deletion in the maltase-glucoamylase gene \\textit{MGAM} involved in starch digestion, in the South American Karitiana and a deletion in the Central African Mbuti in \\textit{SIGLEC5,} potentially leading to immune hyperactivity. We discover a dynamic range of copy number expansions and find cases of regionally-restricted runaway duplications, for example, 18 copies near the olfactory receptor \\textit{OR7D2} in East Asia and in the clinically-relevant \\textit{HCAR2} in Central Asia. We identify highly-stratified putatively introgressed variants from Neanderthals or Denisovans, some of which, like a deletion within \\textit{AQR} in Papuans, are almost fixed in individual populations. Finally, by \\textit{de novo} assembly of 25 genomes using linked-read sequencing we discover 1631 breakpoint-resolved unique insertions, in aggregate accounting for 1.9 Mb of sequence absent from the GRCh38 reference. These insertions show population structure and some reside in functional regions, illustrating the limitation of a single human reference and the need for high-quality genomes from diverse populations to fully discover and understand human genetic variation.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

Epidemiology research often relies on definitions of race and ethnicity, but these population labels may not adequately capture disease burdens specific to sub-populations. Here we propose a framework for repurposing data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in concert with genomic data to explore enrichment of disease within sub-populations. Using data from a diverse biobank in New York City, we genetically identified 17 sub-populations, and noted the presence of genetic founder effects in 7. By then linking community membership to the EHR, we were able to identify over 600 health outcomes that were statistically enriched within a specific population, with many representing known associations, and many others being novel. This work reinforces the utility of linking genomic data to EHRs, and provides a framework towards fine-scale monitoring of population health.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

      "abstract = {{\\textless}h3{\\textgreater}Abstract{\\textless}/h3{\\textgreater} {\\textless}p{\\textgreater}The Viking maritime expansion from Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) marks one of the swiftest and most far-flung cultural transformations in global history. During this time (c. 750 to 1050 CE), the Vikings reached most of western Eurasia, Greenland, and North America, and left a cultural legacy that persists till today. To understand the genetic structure and influence of the Viking expansion, we sequenced the genomes of 442 ancient humans from across Europe and Greenland ranging from the Bronze Age (c. 2400 BC) to the early Modern period (c. 1600 CE), with particular emphasis on the Viking Age. We find that the period preceding the Viking Age was accompanied by foreign gene flow into Scandinavia from the south and east: spreading from Denmark and eastern Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia. Despite the close linguistic similarities of modern Scandinavian languages, we observe genetic structure within Scandinavia, suggesting that regional population differences were already present 1,000 years ago. We find evidence for a majority of Danish Viking presence in England, Swedish Viking presence in the Baltic, and Norwegian Viking presence in Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial foreign European ancestry entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age. We also find that several of the members of the only archaeologically well-attested Viking expedition were close family members. By comparing Viking Scandinavian genomes with present-day Scandinavian genomes, we find that pigmentation-associated loci have undergone strong population differentiation during the last millennia. Finally, we are able to trace the allele frequency dynamics of positively selected loci with unprecedented detail, including the lactase persistence allele and various alleles associated with the immune response. We conclude that the Viking diaspora was characterized by substantial foreign engagement: distinct Viking populations influenced the genomic makeup of different regions of Europe, while Scandinavia also experienced increased contact with the rest of the continent.{\\textless}/p{\\textgreater}},\n",

Here we report on the second phase of a project to build an open resource of high quality data on genome variation among natural populations of the major African malaria vector species \\textit{Anopheles gambiae} and \\textit{Anopheles coluzzii}. We analysed whole genomes of 1,142 individual mosquitoes sampled from the wild in 13 African countries, and a further 234 individuals comprising parents and progeny of 11 lab crosses. The data resource includes high confidence single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls at 57 million variable sites, genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) calls, and haplotypes phased at biallelic SNPs. We used these data to analyse genetic population structure, and characterise genetic diversity within and between populations. We also illustrate the utility of these data by investigating species differences in isolation by distance, genetic variation within proposed gene drive target sequences, and patterns of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides.

With large genomic data sets of populations now appearing more frequently across the taxonomic spectrum, it is becoming increasingly possible to reveal many hierarchical levels of structure, including fine-scale genetic clusters. To analyze these data sets, methods need to be appropriately suited to the challenges of extracting multilevel structure from whole-genome data. Here, we present a network-based approach for constructing population structure representations from genetic data. The use of community-detection algorithms from network theory generates a natural hierarchical perspective on the representation that the method produces. The method is computationally efficient, and it requires relatively few assumptions regarding the biological processes that underlie the data. We show the approach by analyzing population structure in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and in human populations. These examples illustrate how network-based approaches for population structure analysis are well-suited to extracting valuable ecological and evolutionary information in the era of large genomic data sets.},\n",

Frequency spectra of the haplogroups were population-specific and were heterogeneous among geographic regions within Japan. Application of machine learning methods could finely classify the subjects corresponding to the high-digit mtDNA sub-haplogroups. mtDNA had distinct genetic structures from that of nuclear DNA (nDNA), characterized by no distance-dependent linkage disequilibrium decay, sparse tagging of common variants, and the existence of common haplotypes spanning the entire mtDNA. We did not detect any evidence of mtDNA–nDNA (or mtDNA copy number–nDNA) genotype associations. Together with WGS-based mtDNA variant imputation, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of 147,437 Japanese individuals with 99 clinical phenotypes. We observed pleiotropy of mtDNA genetic risk on the five late-onset human complex traits including creatine kinase (P = 1.7 × 10−12).},\n",

      "abstract = {One major challenge to delimiting species with genetic data is successfully differentiating population structure from species-level divergence, an issue exacerbated in taxa inhabiting naturally fragmented habitats. Many fields of science are now using machine learning, and in evolutionary biology supervised machine learning has recently been used to infer species boundaries. These supervised methods require training data with associated labels. Conversely, unsupervised machine learning (UML) uses inherent data structure and does not require user-specified training labels, potentially providing more objectivity in species delimitation. In the context of integrative taxonomy, we demonstrate the utility of three UML approaches (random forests, variational autoencoders, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) for species delimitation in an arachnid taxon with high population genetic structure (Opiliones, Laniatores, Metanonychus). We find that UML approaches successfully cluster samples according to species-level divergences and not high levels of population structure, while model-based validation methods severely over-split putative species. UML offers intuitive data visualization in two-dimensional space, the ability to accommodate various data types, and has potential in many areas of systematic and evolutionary biology. We argue that machine learning methods are ideally suited for species delimitation and may perform well in many natural systems and across taxa with diverse biological characteristics.},\n",

      "abstract = {Human populations feature both discrete and continuous patterns of variation. Current analysis approaches struggle to jointly identify these patterns because of modelling assumptions, mathematical constraints, or numerical challenges. Here we apply uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), a non-linear dimension reduction tool, to three well-studied genotype datasets and discover overlooked subpopulations within the American Hispanic population, fine-scale relationships between geography, genotypes, and phenotypes in the UK population, and cryptic structure in the Thousand Genomes Project data. This approach is well-suited to the influx of large and diverse data and opens new lines of inquiry in population-scale datasets., The demographic history of human populations features varying geographic and social barriers to mating. Over time, these barriers have led to varying levels of genetic relatedness among individuals. This population structure is informative about human history, and can have a significant impact on studies of medical genetics. Because population structure depends on myriad demographic, ecological, and social forces, a priori visualization is useful to identify subtle patterns of population structure. We use a dimension reduction method—UMAP—to visualize population structure in three genomic datasets and find previously unobserved patterns, revealing fine-scale population structure and illustrating differences between groups in traits such as white blood cell count, height, and FEV1, a measure of lung function. Using UMAP is computationally efficient and can identify fine-scale population structure in large population datasets. We find it particularly useful to reveal phenotypic variation among genetically related populations, and recommend it is a complement to principal component analysis in primary data visualization.},\n",

Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.},\n",
